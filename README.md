# About this fork

For Dvorak users, who want to preserve the original (QWERTY) positions of keys used to control Vim-like applications.
Keybingings in the Visual Mode were not configurable, thus I remapped them to match Dvorak layout.

NOTE: Yes, the same can be accomplished by enabling `Ignore keyboard layout` to force the QWERTY layout, however hints used to open links will then also use QWERTY layout forcing user to "think in QWERTY" when opening links. 

I will keep this fork up to date with upstream. If I see interest in this repo, I will make the changes configurable and try to get it merged into the upstream.
